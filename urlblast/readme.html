<h3 class="style1">Configuration files</h3>
<p>
All of the site configuration is now controlled by files in the content\settings folder:
</p>
<ul>
<li>settings.ini - Controls the features and customization of the site</li>
<li>locations.ini - Details on all of the test locations</li>
<li>intro.ini - Introductory paragraph on the main page</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="style1">New Install</h3>
<h4>
Single machine configuration (web server and testers running on the same 
machine):
</h4>
<ul>
<li>You need an XP or 2003 Server (XP is the most supported since that’s what I 
do most dev on)</li>
<li>URLBlast.exe needs to be added to the startup folder (or for testing, just manually started) – 
It is in the “Web Site” folder root</li>
	<li>As far as software goes, you need Apache 2.2+ with PHP 5 installed and mod_rewrite enabled</li>
<li>There is a sample httpd.conf file for Apache in the Web Site folder</li>
	<li>Disk space depends on how much history and volume you’re expecting but the requirements are pretty light – around 250 KB per test run so around 4000 per gig</li>
	<li>Default OS accounts will get created the first time urlblast is run 
	(user1, user2, etc).&nbsp; If you want to override the account names or 
	passwords edit them in urlblast.ini</li>
	<li>The main account you want to use for running the controller software needs to be an admin account and configured to auto login (I use TweakUI to set up the auto login).  Sorry, can’t run locked because the desktop needs to be visible to be able to capture the screen shots).  If your remote system isn’t in a secure location and you don’t trust the remote hands and eyes this is the scariest part since the system will be logged in as an admin all the time (at the console).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiple machine configuration (split web server from testers):</h4>
<h5>Web Server:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The web server can be running any OS that supports Apache 2.2+ and PHP 5 
	(Linux and Windows have been verified to work)</li>
<li>You need Apache 2.2 (or later) installed with mod_rewrite enabled</li>
	<li>You need PHP 5 installed and configured to work with Apache and you need 
	the gd2 plugin enabled</li>
	<li>There is a sample httpd.conf file for Apache in the Web Site folder</li>
	<li>Disk space depends on how much history and volume you’re expecting but the requirements are pretty light – around 250 KB per test run so around 4000 per gig</li>
</ul>
<h5>Test Machine:</h5>
<ul>
<li>You need an XP or 2003 Server (XP is the most supported since that’s what I 
do most dev on)</li>
	<li>Copy urlblast.exe, urlblast.ini and pagetest.dll to a folder on the test 
	machine</li>
<li>URLBlast.exe needs to be added to the startup folder (or for testing, just manually started) – 
It is in the “Web Site” folder root</li>
	<li>Default OS accounts will get created the first time urlblast is run 
	(user1, user2, etc).&nbsp; If you want to override the account names or 
	passwords edit them in urlblast.ini</li>
	<li>The main account you want to use for running the controller software needs to be an admin account and configured to auto login (I use TweakUI to set up the auto login).  Sorry, can’t run locked because the desktop needs to be visible to be able to capture the screen shots).

</ul>
<h3 class="style1">Upgrade Existing Install</h3>
<p>To upgrade an existing install, copy over the whole content folder except for 
the settings directory.&nbsp; You should also update your pagetest.dll and 
urlblast.exe binaries.</p>
<p>Jobsync has been replaced by a doing http posts directly to the web server 
for transmitting jobs around.&nbsp; You'll want to look at the new urlblast.ini 
settings and copy the relevant ones over to your system (or overwrite your 
version and modify the new one).</p>
